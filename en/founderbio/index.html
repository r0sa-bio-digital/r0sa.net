    </p>
    <h3>2007</h3>

      Contributed to the successful international release of a major AAA project of the company. Unique game mechanics based on the physics module I developed have received positive reviews from critics and experts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Opened his own multimedia software development studio and moved to it from a large company.
    </p>
    <h3>2008</h3>
    <p>
      Completed the development and provided the release of 4 own and 4 custom multimedia projects. The team consisted of 7 people. The level of salaries of project participants was 2-3 times higher than the average for the city at that time.

      Carried out the development and provided the release of the casual game "The Wizard's Hat". The team consisted of 3 people. The game was released in 5 languages by the world's leading publishers of casual games of the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Closed own studio in the province and got a job as a programmer in the capital of Russia. Received a job offer from nVidia and Vizerra at the same time, chose Vizerra for a more friendly team and informal atmosphere.
    </p>
    <h3>2010</h3>
    <p>
      Thanks to the experience and managerial skills gained while working in his own studio, was able to take the position of head of the programmer department at the flagship project of the company "Virtual Sochi 2014" for the Organizing Committee of the Olympic Games in Sochi.
    </p>
    <h3>2012</h3>
    <p>
      Ensured the successful release of the "Virtual Sochi 2014" project, meeting exactly the time and budget of the project. As a result of the release, almost all team members received bonuses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Resigned from Vizerra. Summarizing the experience gained in working on a large project, I came to an understanding of the prospects for the development of semantic networks technology in modern software development. Began active independent research in this area. We can say that in October-November of this year, the r0sa bio-digital organization was born.
    </p>
    <h3>2013</h3>
    <p>
      Got a job as a project manager at the Filmlanguage research start-up, associated with the large Bazelevs film studio. Successfully completed several projects related to the old approach to technology implementation and proposed a new, more productive approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within a year, was promoted from project manager to lead architect (analogous to a technical director in a company structure). For the first time, applied some elements of semantic technologies in practice for the design and implementation of innovative technology for the film industry, video games and digital entertainment.
    </p>
    <h3>2015</h3>
    <p>
      Successfully completed a project to study the prospects of the "Kinoyazyk" technology within the framework of "Bazelevs Innovations". Then took up R&amp;D in the field of semantic technologies on his own.
    </p>
    <h3>2016</h3>
    <p>
      Got a job as a project manager at the Irish gaming startup Rocks Pro. Brought the studio's flagship project to a successful release.
    </p>
    <h3>2017</h3>
    <p>
      Received the first investment in the development of semantic technologies from the management of Rocks Pro - the organic web project.
    </p>
    <h3>2018</h3>
    <p>
      Due to difficulties with the sale of ready-made semantic technology, we agreed with Rocks Pro to stop investing in development.
    </p>
    <p>
      Got a job at the London company bioniq as a technical director.
    </p>
    <h3>2019</h3>
    <p>
      Completed the development and implementation of an information system that became the core of medical data processing for all the company's clients. The system was specifically designed for the subsequent implementation of semantic technologies to automate the highly skilled and non-scalable work of the medical director.
    </p>
    <h3>2020</h3>
    <p>
      Organized the purchase of a license for bioniq to use the proprietary organic web system from the copyright holders represented by Rocks Pro. This saved bioniq development time and money, and provided a return on Rocks Pro's investment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Introduced organic web-based semantic technologies into the company's business process, which made it possible to free the medical director from routine operational activities and greatly accelerate the medical processing of clients, especially complex cases.
    </p>
    <h3>2021</h3>
    <p>
      Developed and implemented in the bioniq business processes the knyte space semantic system of his own design to replace the obsolete organic web by that time. As a result, the medical director was able to delegate a significant part of his work on setting up the semantic network to his subordinates.
    </p>
    <h3>2022</h3>
    <p>
      Resigned from bioniq and started 2 own projects based on semantic technologies: commercial c0ntent DAO and non-commercial Metalanguage Foundation.
